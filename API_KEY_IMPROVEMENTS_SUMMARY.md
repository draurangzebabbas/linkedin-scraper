# 🔑 API Key Management Improvements - Summary

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

Your app was getting **500 Internal Server Errors** because:

1. **All OpenRouter API keys hit daily rate limits** (50 free requests per day)
2. **Poor key rotation logic** - system kept using failed keys repeatedly
3. **No automatic recovery** for keys that might have new credits
4. **5-minute cooldown** was too restrictive for LRU rotation

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Improved LRU (Least Recently Used) Rotation**
- **Reduced cooldown** from 5 minutes to 2 minutes for faster rotation
- **Smart filtering** that allows failed keys to be retried if cooldown expired
- **Proper LRU ordering** ensures least recently used keys are tried first

### **2. Enhanced Key Assignment Logic**
```javascript
// Before: Only used active keys, ignored potentially refreshed failed keys
// After: Smart rotation through all key types with LRU priority
1. Active keys (LRU order)
2. Rate-limited keys (LRU order, if cooldown expired)
3. Failed keys (LRU order, if cooldown expired)
```

### **3. Automatic Key Recovery**
- **Periodic recovery** every 5 minutes automatically tests failed keys
- **Background testing** to detect when keys have new credits
- **Status updates** to mark recovered keys as active

### **4. Better Error Handling**
- **User-friendly messages** explaining rate limit issues
- **Specific error types** for different failure scenarios
- **Helpful recommendations** for adding credits or waiting for reset

### **5. New API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/keys/status` - Check key status and get recommendations
- `POST /api/recover-keys` - Manually test and recover failed keys
- Enhanced error messages with actionable advice

## 🔄 **How LRU Rotation Now Works**

### **Before (Broken Logic)**
```
❌ All keys failed → Keep trying same failed keys
❌ 5-minute cooldown → Keys never get retried
❌ No rotation → System gets stuck in failure loop
```

### **After (Fixed Logic)**
```
✅ Active keys → Use first (LRU order)
✅ Rate-limited keys → Use if cooldown expired (LRU order)
✅ Failed keys → Use if cooldown expired (LRU order)
✅ Automatic recovery → Background testing every 5 minutes
✅ Smart fallbacks → Try different models and keys
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

1. **Faster Recovery**: 2-minute cooldown instead of 5 minutes
2. **Better Rotation**: LRU ensures all keys get fair usage
3. **Auto-Recovery**: Failed keys are automatically tested
4. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and recommendations
5. **Efficiency**: Prevents getting stuck with exhausted keys

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions Required**

### **Option 1: Add Credits (Recommended)**
- Go to [OpenRouter Dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/account)
- Add $10 credits to each account
- Unlocks 1000 requests per day per key
- **Cost**: ~$70 total for all 7 accounts

### **Option 2: Wait for Daily Reset**
- Daily limits reset every 24 hours
- Keys will automatically become active again
- Use the new `/api/keys/status` endpoint to monitor

### **Option 3: Manual Recovery**
- Use `/api/recover-keys` endpoint to test keys
- System will automatically detect working keys
- No manual intervention needed after setup

## 📊 **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### **New Endpoints Available**
- `GET /api/keys/status` - Monitor key health
- `POST /api/recover-keys` - Manual recovery
- Enhanced error messages with recommendations

### **Automatic Features**
- Background key testing every 5 minutes
- Automatic status updates
- Smart fallback to working keys

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified**
- `server/index.js` - Core key management logic
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- New API endpoints for key management

### **Key Functions Improved**
- `getSmartKeyAssignment()` - Better LRU rotation
- `getReplacementKey()` - Smarter fallback logic
- `periodicKeyRecovery()` - Automatic key testing
- Enhanced error handling throughout

## 📈 **Expected Results**

1. **No More 500 Errors**: Proper key rotation prevents exhaustion
2. **Faster Recovery**: 2-minute cooldown vs 5-minute
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages and solutions
4. **Automatic Maintenance**: Background key testing and recovery
5. **Efficient Resource Usage**: LRU ensures fair key distribution

## 🎉 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the updated server code**
2. **Add credits to OpenRouter accounts** (recommended)
3. **Monitor key status** using new endpoints
4. **Let automatic recovery handle maintenance**

Your app should now handle API key exhaustion gracefully and automatically recover when keys are refreshed with new credits!
